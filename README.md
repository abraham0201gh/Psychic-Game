The App is a guessing game.  The App randomly selects a letter from the alphabet and the user has to guess which letter the App chose.  

The game includes:  
-	Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
-	Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
-	Guesses Left: (# of guesses left)
-	Guesses So Far: (the specific letters the user typed are displayed until the user either wins or loses the current game)
-	When the player wins, the Wins counter increases and the game restarts anew, without requiring a page refresh
-	When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and the game restarts, again, without a page refresh

Aside from the entertainment value, the App is useful to those learning to code because it implements use of math functions to generate random letters and use of if else statements to either continue or end the game and score the ongoing results.  Additionally, the app records user input to compare the data with the Appâ€™s randomly selected letter.
